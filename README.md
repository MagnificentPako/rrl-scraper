# Why?
Mainly because I was bored. I also wanted to read stuff while I'm offline so this kinda saved my ass.

# Installation
Clone the repo and do `cargo install`. That should add `rrl-scraper` to your cargo path (assuming you know how to use Rust). Maybe there'll be prebuilt things one day.

# Usage
Downloading a single chapter:
```
rrl-scraper chapter 99919
```
Downloading a complete novel:
```
rrl-scraper fiction 8894
```
Both will output to `out.pdf` right now so keep that in mind.

# Contribution
I would love to see other people contribute. I appologize for my bad code in advance though. I whipped this up in ~2 hours, "late" at night (although, my code isn't really "clean" either way, I guess).
